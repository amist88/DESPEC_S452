c++ script to convert Polygon macros in root to a text format for PID gates.

To run:
root -l 
.L PID_mac2txt.cpp
PID("Input.C","Output.txt")

Where Input.C is the name of the input macro and Output.txt is the name of the .txt file to me saved. These values should be copied to (for example if the gate is Z1 vs A/Q
DESPEC_CODE/Configuration_Files/2D_Gates/ZvsAoQ.txt
