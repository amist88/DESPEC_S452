# I M P O R T A N T:
# The coordinate system used by the FATIMA_tofCorr Class is the same
# as that used by AIDA.
# It is right-handed. The Z-axis points down-stream, i.e. in beam direction.
# When looking downstream, in Z-direction:
# X points to the left, Y points up.
# This might be confusing, so be careful. Especially when entering a
# constant offset!

# Set the AIDA offset for DSSDs (in mm) with respect to the focal point at (0,0,0)
# Code currently accepts up to nine DSSDs
# (This will only be applied if USE_AIDA_POS is set to 1)
# For a wide AIDA configuration with several DSSDs in x-direction, these are
# usually handled as one large DSSD in the code, so x and y correction are
# usually not needed and should remain set to 0.

# Set constant offset in mm
